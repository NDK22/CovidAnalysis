# COVID-19 Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a comprehensive COVID-19 dashboard using Tableau for visualization. The data was obtained online, initially as an Excel file, and later directly connected to a SQL Server database. The project demonstrates data extraction, transformation, loading, and visualization techniques.

### Part 1: Data Preparation and SQL Views Creation

**Tools Used:** SQL Server Management Studio 19

**Steps:**

1. **Data Extraction:**  
   - Obtained COVID-19 data online as an Excel file.

2. **Data Loading:**  
   - Imported the Excel data into SQL Server Management Studio 19.

3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Created a new database for the COVID-19 data.
   - Designed and created various SQL views to structure the data appropriately for visualization.

### Part 2: Dashboard Creation in Tableau

**Tools Used:** Tableau, SQL Server

**Steps:**

1. **Data Connection:**  
   - Connected Tableau directly to the SQL Server database to fetch the necessary data for visualization.

2. **Visualization Creation:**  
   - Created four primary visualizations:
     - **Total Deaths per Continent**
     - **Percent of Population Infected per Country**
     - **Monthly Infection Rates for Selected Countries**
     - **Forecasting Future Infection Rates**
   - Customized visualizations with appropriate labels, titles, and color schemes.

3. **Dashboard Assembly:**  
   - Assembled the individual visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
   - Ensured the dashboard was interactive and user-friendly.

4. **Publishing:**  
   - Published the dashboard to Tableau Public for easy sharing and accessibility.

## How to Run This Project

1. **Set Up SQL Server:**
   - Ensure you have SQL Server Management Studio 19 installed.
   - Import the provided SQL script to create the database and views.

2. **Connect Tableau to SQL Server:**
   - Open Tableau and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   - Select the appropriate views for your visualizations.

3. **Recreate Visualizations:**
   - Customize as needed to fit your requirements.

4. **Publish Your Dashboard:**
   - Once the visualizations are complete, assemble them into a dashboard.
   - Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public or save it locally.

## Key Learnings

- **SQL View Creation:** Efficiently creating views in SQL Server to organize and prepare data for visualization.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Tableau to create insightful and interactive visualizations.
- **Data Connection:** Directly connecting Tableau to a SQL database for real-time data updates.
- **Dashboard Design:** Combining multiple visualizations into a single, cohesive dashboard.
